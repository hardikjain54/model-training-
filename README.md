# model-training-
This project is an interactive Machine Learning application built with Streamlit and scikit-learn. It allows users to upload their own datasets (CSV, Excel, TSV, etc.) or use sample data, and automatically guides them through the ML workflow â€” from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and prediction.

The application intelligently detects whether the chosen target column is suited for a classification or regression task, and applies the appropriate models accordingly. Users can experiment with multiple algorithms, compare performance metrics, and visualize results in an easy-to-use web interface.

This project is designed for both beginners who want to learn the basics of machine learning, as well as practitioners who need a quick way to test models on their datasets without writing extensive code.
